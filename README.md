# The data

- I will use the King County Housing Data: This dataset contains information about home sales in King County (USA).
- I use the data in the eda schema of provided database. I access it via DBeaver. Then imported and saved the csv file in the data folder which will not be uploaded to github. 
This process described in `fetching_the_data_alchemy.ipynb`
- I explored the dataset in DBeaver and came up with a Join for the 2 tables.
- The description of the column names can be found in the `column_names.md` file.

# The Tasks and Deliverables

1. Through EDA/statistical analysis above I came up with **3 insights** regarding the overall data.
This work can be found in the `EDA.ipynb` file.

3. In addition came up with **3 recommendations** for my client.

_I took the perspective of a seller_

4. A **short Google Slides presentation** giving a **high-level overview** of my methodology and recommendations for **non-technical clients**. 
Find the pdf of `presentation.pdf` in this repository as well.
